## Welcome!

Welcome to the development team! We are thrilled you are here and a part of our team. Our team wants to do amazing things and delight our customers. We believe our values and principles guide us to be great at what we do.

### Our Team Values

These are the values that we, as a team, decided best define what we care about. The first 5 come from the book [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0321278658) and the last, joyfulness, was chosen ad-hoc.

communication

simplicity

feedback

courage

respect

joyfulness

The resources on this site all serve to reinforce and align us to these values. Take the time to really investigate and understand the information here. Add to it and help us make it a great way of "booting" others into our culture.
