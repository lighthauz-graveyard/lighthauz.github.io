## Sites

Martin Fowler's [website](http://martinfowler.com) is a treasure trove of architectural goodness.

Uncle Bob Martin has a series of videos at [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com). They are all worth watching.

[Live In Greatness](http://liveingreatness.com) is a well-designed site that does a great job laying out The Core Protocols. We find the [Ask for Help](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ask-for-help/) protocol to be very useful. 

[Refactoring](https://refactoring.guru) is another well-designed site. This one has a catalog of bad "code smells" as well as good refactoring methods to address the "smells".
