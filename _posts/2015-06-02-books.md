## Books

### Must Reads

The books in this section are critical to being able to understand why we do some of the things we do as a development organization. They help to describe the foundational under-pinings of what we feel make up great teams that do awesome things.

#### [Rework](http://amzn.com/0307463745)
Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson

This is a book where the authors are not afraid to share their opinions. Not everything they discuss will have application to our situation, but a good 80%+ will. This book is about what worked for the authors in the "real world" and many of their findings mirror what we are creating.

#### [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](http://amzn.com/0787960756)
Patrick M. Lencioni

There are tons of books discussing teams in the context of agile and lean, but they are typically tied up with methodologies like Scrum. This book is not like that. It is an allegorical tale highlighting how the breakdown in key values of an organization lead to dysfunction. It is short, fun to read and very instructive.

#### [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware](http://amzn.com/1934356050)
Andy Hunt

We value learning and problem solving. This book will help you to understand just how your own brain does its thing, helping you to improve and *refactor* your own mind.

#### [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://amzn.com/020161622X)
Andrew Hunt, David Thomas

This book uses real life examples and experiences to illustrate what the authors have found to work in the course of software development. It is a great companion book to the previous one.

#### [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0321278658)
Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres

Why are teams in development important? What is pairing? How is continuous integration/deployment useful? This is the book that really answers those questions and more.

### Deeper Dives

These books, while not being *must reads*, are nevertheless worth the time and energy.

#### [Effective Java, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0321356683)
Joshua Bloch

If you are coding with Java and haven't read this book, then you are missing out. This book will help you become a better Java developer. It is older, but the practices are just as relevant.

#### [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://amzn.com/0321127420)
Martin Fowler

This book is older, and yet, it still has so much value. It doesn't go into some of the newer architectural thinking, but many of the patterns here are still being used on a daily basis.

#### [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer](http://amzn.com/0321721330)
Sandi Metz

While this book is using Ruby as the langauge for the examples, the concepts discussed are applicable to most OO languages. Sandi does a great job of helping describe how to make OO design decisions work, especially in organizations wanting to deal with change. Just try to think of the Ruby on the pages as pseudo code and enjoy.
