## Podcasts

[Agile Weekly](http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/) is a locally produced podcast discussing agile, yes, but also anything related to culture and organization greatness.

[The McCarthy Show](http://www.mccarthyshow.com/episodes/) is produced by Jim and Michelle McCarthy, both ex-Microsoft managers. They are also responsible for [The Core Protocols](http://www.mccarthyshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/The+Core+Protocols+3.03.pdf) which they discuss on their podcast.
