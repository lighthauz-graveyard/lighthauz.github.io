<p>Welcome to the development team! We are thrilled you are here and a part of our team. Our team wants to do amazing things and delight our customers. We believe our values and principles guide us to be great at what we do.</p>

<h3 id="our-team-values">Our Team Values</h3>

<p>These are the values that we, as a team, decided best define what we care about.</p>

<p>decisiveness</p>

<p>joyfulness</p>

<p>reliability</p>

<p>respect</p>

<p>simplicity</p>

<p>trust</p>

<p>The resources on this site all serve to reinforce and align us to these values. Take the time to really investigate and understand the information here. Add to it and help us make it a great way of “booting” others into our culture.</p>

          <h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<h3 id="must-reads">Must Reads</h3>

<p>The books in this section are critical to being able to understand why we do some of the things we do as a development organization. They help to describe the foundational under-pinings of what we feel make up great teams that do awesome things.</p>

<h4 id="reworkhttpamzncom0307463745"><a href="http://amzn.com/0307463745">Rework</a></h4>
<p>Jason Fried &amp; David Heinemeier Hansson</p>

<p>This is a book where the authors are not afraid to share their opinions. Not everything they discuss will have application to our situation, but a good 80%+ will. This book is about what worked for the authors in the “real world” and many of their findings mirror what we are creating.</p>

<h4 id="the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-teamhttpamzncom0787960756"><a href="http://amzn.com/0787960756">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a></h4>
<p>Patrick M. Lencioni</p>

<p>There are tons of books discussing teams in the context of agile and lean, but they are typically tied up with methodologies like Scrum. This book is not like that. It is an allegorical tale highlighting how the breakdown in key values of an organization lead to dysfunction. It is short, fun to read and very instructive.</p>

<h4 id="pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-refactor-your-wetwarehttpamzncom1934356050"><a href="http://amzn.com/1934356050">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</a></h4>
<p>Andy Hunt</p>

<p>We value learning and problem solving. This book will help you to understand just how your own brain does its thing, helping you to improve and <em>refactor</em> your own mind.</p>

<h4 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-masterhttpamzncom020161622x"><a href="http://amzn.com/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a></h4>
<p>Andrew Hunt, David Thomas</p>

<p>This book uses real life examples and experiences to illustrate what the authors have found to work in the course of software development. It is a great companion book to the previous one.</p>

<h4 id="extreme-programming-explained-embrace-change-2nd-editionhttpamzncom0321278658"><a href="http://amzn.com/0321278658">Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition</a></h4>
<p>Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres</p>

<p>Why are teams in development important? What is pairing? How is continuous integration/deployment useful? This is the book that really answers those questions and more.</p>

<h3 id="deeper-dives">Deeper Dives</h3>

<p>These books, while not being <em>must reads</em>, are nevertheless worth the time and energy.</p>

<h4 id="effective-java-2nd-editionhttpamzncom0321356683"><a href="http://amzn.com/0321356683">Effective Java, 2nd Edition</a></h4>
<p>Joshua Bloch</p>

<p>If you are coding with Java and haven’t read this book, then you are missing out. This book will help you become a better Java developer. It is older, but the practices are just as relevant.</p>

<h4 id="patterns-of-enterprise-application-architecturehttpamzncom0321127420"><a href="http://amzn.com/0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a></h4>
<p>Martin Fowler</p>

<p>This book is older, and yet, it still has so much value. It doesn’t go into some of the newer architectural thinking, but many of the patterns here are still being used on a daily basis.</p>

<h4 id="practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-an-agile-primerhttpamzncom0321721330"><a href="http://amzn.com/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer</a></h4>
<p>Sandi Metz</p>

<p>While this book is using Ruby as the langauge for the examples, the concepts discussed are applicable to most OO languages. Sandi does a great job of helping describe how to make OO design decisions work, especially in organizations wanting to deal with change. Just try to think of the Ruby on the pages as pseudo code and enjoy.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler’s <a href="http://martinfowler.com">website</a> is a treasure trove of architectural goodness.</p>

<p>Uncle Bob Martin has a series of videos at <a href="https://cleancoders.com">Clean Coders</a>. They are all worth watching.</p>

<p><a href="http://liveingreatness.com">Live In Greatness</a> is a well-designed site that does a great job laying out The Core Protocols. We find the <a href="https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ask-for-help/">Ask for Help</a> protocol to be very useful.</p>

<p>While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Sam-Newman/dp/1491950358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436558554&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=building+microservices">Building Microservices</a> it reinforced the importance of the <a href="http://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2012/04/17/DDD-The-Bounded-Context-Explained.aspx/">Bounded Context</a> in identifying the service boundaries. It also provided these reaffirming quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When starting out, however, keep a new system on the more monolithic side; getting service boundaries wrong can be costly, so waiting for things to stabilize as you get to grips with a new domain is sensible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying to go to microservices from the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those quotes tie into the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">MonolithFirst</a> article by Martin Fowler.</p>
