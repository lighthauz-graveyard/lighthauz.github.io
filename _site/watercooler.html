<p>While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Sam-Newman/dp/1491950358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436558554&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=building+microservices">Building Microservices</a> it reinforced the importance of the <a href="http://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2012/04/17/DDD-The-Bounded-Context-Explained.aspx/">Bounded Context</a> in identifying the service boundaries. It also provided these reaffirming quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When starting out, however, keep a new system on the more monolithic side; getting service boundaries wrong can be costly, so waiting for things to stabilize as you get to grips with a new domain is sensible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying to go to microservices from the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those quotes tie into the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">MonolithFirst</a> article by Martin Fowler.</p>
