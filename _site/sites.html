<h2 id="sites">Sites</h2>

<p>Martin Fowler’s <a href="http://martinfowler.com">website</a> is a treasure trove of architectural goodness.</p>

<p>Uncle Bob Martin has a series of videos at <a href="https://cleancoders.com">Clean Coders</a>. They are all worth watching.</p>

<p><a href="http://liveingreatness.com">Live In Greatness</a> is a well-designed site that does a great job laying out The Core Protocols. We find the <a href="https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ask-for-help/">Ask for Help</a> protocol to be very useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://refactoring.guru">Refactoring</a> is another well-designed site. This one has a catalog of bad “code smells” as well as good refactoring methods to address the “smells”.</p>
